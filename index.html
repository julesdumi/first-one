		<p>Are you thinking of creating of your own sample pack? Do you feel like your sounds could be useful to other producers? In this article you’ll find 10 tips for creating professional, original sample packs you can sell online. 

 Plan the sample pack
Before starting the sound design work, it’s helpful to plan the approach to making your sample pack. By setting your goals clearly, you make sure that you’re going to be working with maximum productivity. Here are a few questions you can ask yourself:

How many samples do I need to complete the sample pack?
When making your first sample pack, it’s better to stick to a smaller number of samples to make sure you are not sacrificing quality for quantity.

When do I expect to finish working on the sample pack?
After you specify how many samples you need, it’s time to set specific deadlines. Do you want to work on the sample packs for one, two weeks or more? How many samples would you need to make per day in that case?

What type of sounds do I want to make?
Are you planning on creating drums or melodies? Do you want to make loops or one-shots? How many sounds should be included in each category? Setting up the folder structure of your sample pack in advance might help with planning its contents.

		<p>Design sounds in contexts
A helpful technique of making sample packs is producing short tracks or loops and extracting their individual elements at a later stage. In this way you are making sure that the samples you’re using are going to sound good in context - and it’s sometimes more fun to create music rather than single sounds. This technique can be applied to tracks you have already made - as long as the sounds you’ve used are completely original, you can quickly create samples by exporting the stems.

		<p>The universally accepted format of samples is WAV, which provides high-quality uncompressed audio and is compatible with most DAWs. Sounds are usually exported using 44.1 kHz and 24 bits. An alternative to WAV is AIFF - but it is much less common.
